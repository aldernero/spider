# spider-builder

This directory is reserved for a future web-based tool for building spider charts interactively.

The tool will provide a web interface where users can:
- Configure axes and their scales
- Add and style data series
- Customize chart appearance
- Preview charts in real-time
- Export charts in various formats

This is planned for future development.
